Note: The showcase of the event lister was supposed to be a video, but due to the file being too large, I had to settle for an image.

<h1>PURPOSE:</h1>

The application's main purpose is to showcase my current abilities (my capabilities during the time this project was commited). 
However, you can use my application for simple tasks such as knowing what time of the day it is, what the current date is, and placing an event/occasion of your liking (like birthdays) on specific dates.

FILES USED:

<pre>
img/  
  arrow.png  
  cover.png  
  daysky.jpg  
  nightsky.avif  
  nightsky2.jpg  
index.html  
style.css  
main.js
</pre>
<br />

<h1>MAJOR FUNCTIONS:</h1>

The application has a BUILT-IN CALENDAR on the left side of the page that automatically highlights the current date of the current month in strong colors, then the other dates of the current month in a lighter color.
The dates of inactive months, however, are highlighted in gray circles. You can traverse through the months using the arrows on the navigation, which are right on top of the calendar itself.

Meanwhile, at the right side of the page is an EVENT LISTER. At the very top of the event-lister is the current day of the week as well as the current date in text form.
Below that is the actual lists of events, where the elements are displayed via a container. When there's a certain number of elements, the list provides a scrollbar.
You can ENTER AN EVENT using the form at the very bottom of the event lister.

<h1>FILES</h1>

<ol>
  <li>
    <h3>img</h3>
    This is the image folder. It contains the images used in both the background of the event lister and the navigation arrows. The other files [nightsky, nightsky2, daysky] could be used as alternatives to the current cover image.
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>index.html</h3>
    This is the main page of the web-application. It has 3 meta tags: 
    <ul>
      <li>Sets the charset to UTF-8</li>
      <li>Sets the webpage to fit in mobile devices by setting the viewport to the device-width and a fixed initial-scale of 1</li>
      <li>Renders the internet explorer to IE-8(standard view)</li>
    </ul>
    It has 2 main parts:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h3>The Calendar</h3>
        This is the part of the webpage where the actual calendar is in place. In its header is the current year, current time, as well as the navigation arrows which you can use to traverse through previous and proceeding months. In its body are the dates of the                current month.
